### Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide Project

The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set
of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist
format, that can be integrated into the development life-cycle.

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather then on vulnerabilities or exploits.
It is designed to serve as a secure coding kick-start tool and easy reference,
to help development teams quickly understand secure coding practices.

### Sections of the Guide

* Introduction
* Secure coding practices checklist
* Software security principles overview
* Glossary of important terminology
* Links to useful resources

Key areas covered in the checklist :

* Input Validation
